## Introduction

In this document can be found a description about the usage and requirements of Mopidy. It's purpose is to provide the users the possibility of setting up a server that allows them to browse music whether through [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org) or [web clients](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/web/#ext-web). It was made to be very customizable so the users can enjoy it the way they want , it was thought to be versatile so it can play music from major cloud services through the usage of [extensions] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_extension) ( installable add-ons to extend capabilities of a software ). 


## Requirements

### System Requirements

Mopidy requires a Unix based system (for example a Linux distribution or a Macintosh) with network connectivity and audio output.

### Elicitation and Analysis

New features can be suggested essentially by everyone, however, the ones that are added are a mix of what the developers feel is most important/requested and other functionality they think is fun to make, even though they may only be useful for a very limited number of users or for specific use cases.

The suggestions and discussions of these features take place in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/issues) of the Github repository, which later are merged upstream through the use of pull requests.

### Specification

Mopidy itself does not have a SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document, however, there are some other documents available which explain the inner workings of the software:
* [Glossary](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/glossary/)
* [Mopidy Command](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command/)
* [API Reference](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/)
* [Module Reference](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/)
