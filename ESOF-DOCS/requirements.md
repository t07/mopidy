## Introduction

## Requirements

### System Requirements

Mopidy requires a Unix based system (for example a Linux distribution or a Macintosh) with network connectivity and audio output.

### Elicitation and Analysis

New features can be suggested essentially by everyone, however, the ones that are added are a mix of what the developers feel is most important/requested and other functionality they think is fun to make, even though they may only be useful for a very limited number of users or for specific use cases.

The suggestions and discussions of these features take place in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/issues) of the Github repository, which later are merged upstream through the use of pull requests.

### Specification

Mopidy itself does not have a SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document, however, there are some other documents available which explain the inner workings of the software:
* [Glossary](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/glossary/)
* [Mopidy Command](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command/)
* [API Reference](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/)
* [Module Reference](https://mopidy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/)
